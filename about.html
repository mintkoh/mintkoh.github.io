<h2>About</h2>

<p>
Hi, I'm mintkoh!<br><br>
I finished my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science in 2020 and in 2021 I'm focusing in studying pentesting and ethical hacking with online resources.<br>
This website will contain writeups of solved machines, CTFs and cybersecurity notes.<br><br>
Nice to meet you!<br><br>
